## Usage

This is an incomplete project which was used to upload any file to your onedrive business account. (Yes there are api's for it,but your administrator might not allow you to create an application for your business account.)

The code manages to open the Open File Dialog Box for you to select the required file to upload it on to your ondrive .(90% of the code is done)

Further modificitaions can be made to the code such that when provided with the login credentials and the file path, the code can manage to upload the specified file automatically.

At the very least,the code can be used as very simple password manager which autlogin's you to your accounts whith small modifications.

## Contribution SetUp
