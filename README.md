A small poem for u(Zense)

This hackathon held by ZENSE.
At first, made us tense.

But........

With ur kindness u got our attention;
Every time v asked something u planted a seed Of motivation.

Thankyou Zense for being there;
Thankyou for showing concern and care.

Thankyou for keeping us in the track;
Thankyou for helping with what we lack.

For being what u r;
U have always been our college superstars.  

It may look like We r bluffing;
But its actually a thankful opening.


                                                    COVID-19 CONTACT TRACER
                                                                                                  
IDEA OF THE PROJECT : 
 Our main idea is to stop the spreading of Covid-19.We made a contact tracer application which warns us through an email when any previously contacted person gets infected. This may help us to take precautions or by being self quarantine may reduce the spreading of corona virus.
 
IMPLEMENTATION:
We tried to implement it using Tkinter and database connectivity.We used Tkinter to develop the UI for the application. For maintaining the data of all the users we needed a database and also the database which can be used by all the people all over the world we needed a database server, so for that we used MySql. We had also planned to make the mailing system but could not implement it in the code. At present the takes input from the user and adds the user to the Database and we can add our contacts and update our current status.

DIFFICULTIES FACED:
The issues which came up during implementation were :
 Making the Mysql database remotely accessable was a issue as we were unaware of the steps to do it. We tried to solve this issue by looking throught stackoverflow pages and trying to implement and undestand the solution given there.
 Python implementation of connecting the database was also a tough part.We used youtube videos and some tutorials to overcome it.
 It was really difficult to manage the control flow of gui,for example checking the order of windows,We actually have 4 windows to display.To overcome this all I did is to check with  >>>>>>>>>patience<<<<<<<.
 Labelling variables was also one of the biggest task,dealt it with naming variables as clear as possible however long it may be. 
 
WHAT WE LEARNED:
We learnt how to give database connectivity to a python file and also how to give remote access and how to use that access of a database using a python file. Also we learnt to make a complicated GUI using Tkinter and explored the Tkinter module as much as possible. We could have implemented more but than could not have learned more details. We also wanted to learn how to make a automatic mailing system to send notifications, but could not do it but will surely research and learn about it. We also wanted to make the app with location optimized and learn how to get location access and use it. We both basically found our interests and both had similar.
