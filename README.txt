RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR:
*******************************
1.Idea of our project:
We live in a society where sharing anything on social media platforms is not safe and
any data the users share among themselves/colleagues/friends is easily traceable 
and vulnerable by breaches.
So we have tried writing a code which can generate Random password, depending 
on the length of password the user wants . The password generated is a combination
of alphabets,numbers and characters.
This is not only beneficial to the user but it also ensures that it not easily hackable.
 
2.Implementation:
We have implemented the project by using few modules like tkinter,random,string and pyperclip.
We have tried including two classes, Generator and copy password.
Generator helps in generating a random password everytime the user clicks on the 'Generate password' button.
This was accomplished by using the "random" module.
Copy password button helps us to copy the password to the clipboard.

3. Problems faced while implementing the code and how did we overcome it:
We were facing problem in using the random module as it was difficult for us to deal with it. We didn't know the proper syntax
for implementing most of the commands and tried googling and searching for videos on youtube.However ,it was easy to understand
and implement the same after researching on it.
Intially we had around 100 lines of code which basically consisted of random module commands and  some extra, unnecessary commands.
We did face difficulty in shortening it and using tricks to make it equally efficient.

4.What did we learn from this project:
This was the first time that we had taken part in the college hackathon. Though tiresome, this was a great idea ,as we have learnt
how to use and implement specific commands. It did give us a lot more confidence to code.We enjoyed learning and researching on
certain topics which we were completely unaware of.

Waiting for many more fun , informative activities and hackathons.
Thank you Zense!
